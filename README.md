# Airplanes-Console-Game


A simple Python console-based game inspired by the classic Airplanes board game.
The game has 2 phases: 
1. The placement of the planes-Strategically position your two available planes on a 10X10 grid.
2. Gameplay-Take turns guessing coordinates where you think your opponent's planes might be. But be careful! Hitting the head of a planes destroys the entire aircraft!
The first player to destroy all of their opponents plaes wins!
